            <p>
            Most of my work experience relates to real estate; As a Property Manager, my first and foremost responsibility has been to take care of and manage the needs of multiple properties. Whether I may be negotiating contracts with an individual tenant, resolving an emergency at another property, and updating my supervisor on the state of all properties, I am constantly working to increase the value of each property. 
            </p><p>
            Notably, I have also developed strong interpersonal and analytical skills within my career. As a liaison between owners, tenants, supervisors, and attorneys, I continually work to preserve and strengthen relationships to satisfy all parties.
